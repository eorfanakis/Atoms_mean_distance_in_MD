# Atoms_mean_distance_in_MD
Find the mean distance of an atomtype in MD simulations using desmond during the whole period of the simulation.
Prepare the text file before you start so Rstudio can open the file. (.mae files were used for all the frames of the simulation)
Extract from the software the ligands for all the frames
Find the atomtype from your file
Put the atomtype that exist in your molecules and edit their number
You can also check the minimum distance, the maximum distance (between simulation time), check if it is stationary and export diagrams.
Ensure that the mentioned columns exist at your file 
*works for more than 1 molecule (36 is for my occasion: 36 octanol molecules)
